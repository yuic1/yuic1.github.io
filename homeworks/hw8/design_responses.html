						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Dark Patterns are the cases of UX/UI interactions that are deceptive so that it might mislead the users. Unlike 'bad designs,' which mistakenly mislead users because a web designer/creater is lazy or lack of skills, 'dark patterns' are not by mistake. They fool users on purpose. </p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I enjoyed 3 moments in this article. First of all, I liked the clarification of the difference between a bad design and dark patterns. Second, the LinkedIn case was interesting case to read to learn more about dark patterns that fooled users and went to the lawsuits in real life. Lastly, by enumberating 11 types of dark patterns and going over one by one, it helped me clearly identify bad patterns.  </p>
