<p>Hello everyone, I'm an international student from South Korea, graduating this year! I'm happy to join this WDD course since I've always wanted to make an amazing website to introduce myself. You know, paper resumes are boring. Down below, I put my favorite places to eat and a website I like to spend my time the most!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Xpression</li>
    <li>Koja Kitchen</li>
    <li>Kimchi Garden</li>
</ul>

<br><br><p>Here's my reading responses:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I've learned what I need to take account of when designing an app: hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. Observing other apps is a good lesson to learn designing tips and details.</li>
    <li>The favorite moment I enjoyed while reading this aritcle is to see the way she deconstruct the apps. By doing that, it was so much easier for me to see the intent of the developer. It showed my how much details developers try to put.</li>
    <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." </li>
    <li>I would say I enjoyed this article about score of 9. I liked to learn a good mindset to have when designing apps and websites.</li>
