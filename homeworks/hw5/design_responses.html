                            <p> I've learned in some cases, making the cursor clearly visible (round circle shape cursor) for better UI interaction. Also, rather than making every single animation move simultaneously, making them one at a time only when a user's cursor hovers the section is better not to distract them too much. All of the sections in a webiste associated with UI interaction are not text-heavy but focused on images or graphs.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I like it that the UI interaction examples show in website visitors' point of view. The varied ways of presenting their UI interaction systems based on their business type. Each UI interaction design has their own distinctive combination of scrolling, clicking, or hovering. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I like the "Dark by BestServedBold for Green Chameleon," the Netflix UI interaction design, the most. I'm not a big fan of UI interaction designs with so many visual effects or fast-moving animations since they distract me and make me dizzy. However, the "Dark" design has a power to draw my attention. Simply put, it makes me focus and makes me curious about the TV show.  </p>

                            <p> 8. This article is interesting since it provides me plenty of good examples of UI interaction designs. </p>
