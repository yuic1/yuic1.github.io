					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Identifying the purpose, audience, look for inspriation and then choose my fonts. When representing an image-driven page, a simple font is a good choice not to distract from the images. Pairing inspriation is also crucial to establish visual hierarchy and construct better readability of the overall design. Choosing a font size based on the golden ratio (1:1.618) or perfect fourth (3:4) is a good way to know.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the part where the aricle actually specified the appropriate fonts for children--Sasson Primary. Rather than introducing ambiguously, I like this approach to specify an example because I can apply it to my website right away. Taking account my color palette came to me as good advice since I've always agonized by choosing colors when I feel it's a good color choice but they don't harmonize somehow.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> After clarifiying the purpose of your design, identify your audience. This step is crucial because information about your users such as age, interests, and cultural upbringing could influence the decisions you make for your type. ...before choosing a font, research its intended purpose. </p>
						</li>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I'd say 10 because this article is so easy to read and actually is giving outside sources </p>
