					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color accessibility allows people with vision issues to interact with digital experiences as if they don't have the deficiencies. To meet minimum AA rating, the ratio of the web page components, the background-to-text contrast should be at least 4:5:1. Colorable and Colorsafe helps designers to find appropriate color combinations to use.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like the part where the article points out not to rely solely on color. Rather than adressing an unconditional faith in colors, the suggestions for system warnings or iconography made this article more reliable. Also, adding patterns or texture to graphs or charts also comes to be as a creative idea not only for people with vision deficiencies but also for attention-grabbing method.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don't be rude." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I'd say 6--when it touches legal implications for not complying with regulator requirements, I was kind of lost. But after I got the grasp of what this article's talking about, it became intersting. </p>
