					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. Also, diagonal appearance is better than zigzag appearance. I learned about a function cubic-bezier to describe the curves and hope to apply to my work some day.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Even if the differences are unrecognizable for some cases, comparing the different display helped me to understand (blue and red). The animations used to explain the difference were also helpful. Not all, but most of the cases, the graphs are also useful if the text-explnation was hard to understand.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 6. This article is very useful since it points out what is good amount for each User Experiences in terms of position and time of disply elements. However, at the same time, the article contains so many graphs and cases, so I feel a bit pressured while reading.</p>
