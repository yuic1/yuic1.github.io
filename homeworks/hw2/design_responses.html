					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Padding is an empty space that could provide visual clarity and balance to a layout. Wayfair design team follows a rule of spacing elements with a multiple of 8 pixels. The paddings also helpful in drawing users' attention to a particular element.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like the article shows the comparison between the PDPs with different spacing strategy. It vividly comes to show me that with poor spacing strategy, it could somehow make user feel stuffy and eventually make them lose their attention. Also, this article clarifies that white space do not need to filled with content, by quoting "less is more." </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe. White space is not wasted space. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
